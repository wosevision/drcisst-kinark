                    <h2>CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT</h2>
                    <h4>“Helping The Helpers”</h4>
    
                    <blockquote></blockquote>
    
                    <h4>REMEMBER these things about a critical incident in your life...</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are having a normal reaction to an abnormal event.</li>
                        <li>You are not losing it, you are finding a sense of self and your sense of decency.</li>
                        <li>You are not the only one experiencing these reactions right now.</li>
                        <li>You are not less capable or less competent. You are not weak, a wimp or unstable.</li>
                        <li>You are NOT alone.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <blockquote></blockquote>
    
                    <h4>STRESS REACTION...</h4>
                    <p><b>ACUTE</b></p>
                    <p>Response to a specific incident Immediate reaction or within three days</p>
                    <p><b>DELAYED</b></p>
                    <p>Out of the blue</p>
                    <p>Seems unconnected to any incident</p>
                    <p><b>ACCUMULATED</b></p>
                    <p>Built up over a long period of time Gradual erosion of coping resources</p>
    
                    <h4>ALLEVIATING STRESS...</h4>
                    <p>Begins with owning your stress responses. Not... owning the event...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verbalize your frustrations. Talking about the obstacles that create frustration often leads to an increased ability to cope.
                        <li>Figure out why you are reacting, The better you understand yourself, the better you will adjust.
                        <li>Identify obstacles that block you.
                        <li>Plan strategies to go around obstacles.
                        <li>Be persistent to reach your goal, working smarter not harder. þBe prepared to accept some degree of failure.
                        <li>Search for benefits when stressors arise.
                        <li>Laughter is good medicine for the mind.
                        <li>Play.
                        <li>Ask for help from people you care about - you will return the gift. þLearn to compromise.
                        <li>Listen to others’ needs, but decide when and IF you can meet them.
                        <li>Give yourself credit for what you do well and acknowledge what you don’t do well.
                        <li>Accept responsibility for your actions, feeling and thoughts. þSet limits for your external and internal worlds.
                        <li>Accept that you are less than perfect.
                        <li>Love and be loved.
                    </ul>
    
                ￼    <h4>THINGS TO TRY...</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strenuous physical exercise, alternating with relaxation will alleviate some of the physical reaction.</li>
                        <li>You’re normal and having normal reactions - don’t label yourself crazy.</li>
                        <li>Talk to people - talk is the most healing medicine.</li>
                        <li>Be aware of numbing the pain with overuse of drugs or alcohol, you don’t need to complicate this with a substance abuse problem.</li>

                        <li>Maintain as normal a schedule as possible, structure your time, keep busy.</li>
                        <li>Spend time with others.</li>

                        <li>Reoccurring thoughts, dreams or flashbacks are normal - don’t try to fight them - they will decrease over time and become less painful.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>SUGGESTED DIETARY CHANGES...</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Eat less fat - less red meat, more poultry, fish; less butter and lard.</li>
                        <li>Reducesaturatedfats-thatarehighestintop-qualityred meats, organ meats, butter, egg yolks, cheeses, lard, hydrogenated fats; use vegetable oil or margarine.</li>
                        <li>Reduce protein intake to less than 300g per day - consider other protein sources; tofu, beans(legumes), soybeans, corn, barley, oatmeal, whole wheat. Eat the right type of carbohydrates: brown or wild rice, whole wheat or stone ground breads or pita breads and whole wheat pasta.</li>
                        <li>Eat more fibre - such as whole bran or whole grain. Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables, eaten raw if possible.</li>
                        <li>Reduce refined sugars, flours - sugar levels are high in soft drinks and desserts, also in many condiments, salad dressings, sauces, breads and crackers. Sugar is needed for energy but it is better to it get from complex carbohydrates found in bread and vegetables rather than from the simple sugars such as table sugar, honey and molasses, which raise blood/body fat and cholesterol levels.</li>
                        <li>Avoid Carcinogens and additives - nitrates are linked with stomach cancer and are found in smoked and cured meats and fish; ham, luncheon meats such as bologna, corned beef, sausage, hot dogs, smoked salmon.</li>
                        <li>Eat less salt- reduce amounts in cooking. Season with herbs, spices, lemon juice. Keep the salt shaker off the table. Be aware that many processed foods contain salt.</li>
                        <li>Drink less coffee and tea - caffeine induces acid secretion in the stomach, leading to heartburn and ulcers. Caffeine is now also thought to contribute to heart disease, atherosclerosis and diabetes by increasing free fatty acids in the blood.</li>
                        <li>Vitaminsandminerals-abalanced,varieddietshouldsupply most of your needs, but you may want to consider supplementing your diet with vitamins B, C and E plus minerals. Check with your doctor regarding your particular needs.</li>
                        <li>Reduce or eliminate alcohol and cigarettes - both are known health hazards and contribute to heart disease and circulatory disease. Heavy cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung cancer and other types of cancer.</li>
                    </ol>
    
                    <h4>CANADA’S GUIDE to healthy eating</h4>
                    <h1>****FOOD GUIDE GOES HERE****</h1>
                    <p>Excerpt from Health Canada: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/fg_rainbow-arc_en_ciel_ga_e.html</p>
    
                    <h4>CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS...</h4>
                    <p>is a normal reaction to sudden and unexpected events beyond that range of normal human experience. On average, 80% of individuals exposed to a critical incident will experience a reaction.</p>
                    <p>In its mildest form, this stress can disrupt an individual’s day-to-day functioning; at its most severe, this stress reaction may become chronic and have serious, long-term health and relationship consequences.</p>
                    <p>How an individual reacts varies from person to person and depends on several factors: the type of event, its intensity and duration, the suddenness with which it occurs, past experiences, coping strategies and social supports. These reactions can cause additional stress in the sufferer, their families and co-workers. If they are left un-managed...REACTIONS CAN BECOME SYMPTOMS. It is a wise and healthy choice to take care NOW. With understanding, support and care of yourself (and by people who care about you), stress reactions usually pass more quickly. Occasionally the traumatic event is so painful that professional assistance from a physician or therapist may be necessary, this does not mean that a person is weak or crazy - it simply indicates that the reaction to this particular event was powerful.</p>
    
                    <blockquote><b>This booklet is dedicated to emergency personnel.</b> Their critical incident experiences (personal losses, traumatic stimuli, mission failure) have prompted and refined the Critical Incident Stress Management Process.<br>
                    <b>HELPING THE HELPERS</b> benefits emergency personnel, their families and our community.</blockquote>
