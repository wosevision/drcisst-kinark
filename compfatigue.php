						<li>Compassion Fatigue – It’s not a character flaw!</li></ol>

						<blockquote>When Compassion Fatigue leaves, the Joy of Caring returns.</blockquote>

						<li>Sense of inadequacy • Sense of entitlement</li>
						<li>Perception of the world in terms of victims and perpetrators</li>
						<li>Personal activities interrupted by the mission</li></ul>

						<h4>Symptoms of Compassion Fatigue (avoidance)</h4>
						<ul><li>Silencing Response (avoiding client’s stuff)</li>
						<li>Loss of enjoyment/cessation of self-care activities</li>
						<li>Loss of energy</li>
						<li>Loss of hope/sense of dread working with certain clients</li>
						<li>Loss of sense of competence/potency</li>
						<li>Isolation</li>

						<h4>A Word about Sleep</h4>
						<ul><li>Sleep disruption is both:
						<ul><li>A key indicator of Compassion Fatigue, and</li>
						<li>One of the primary causes of Compassion Fatigue</li></ul></li>
						<li>Sleep Disruption is a key symptom of Compassion Fatigue
						<ul><li>When a care giver’s sleep pattern is disrupted for an extended period of time, this is a key warning sign that something is wrong. If normal sleep patterns aren’t reestablished, this combined with other symptoms may indicate that the caregiver is developing “Compassion Fatigue”.</li></ul></li>
						<li>DisruptionofNormalSleepPatternscanbea primary cause of Compassion Fatigue
						<ul><li>It is during normal “deep” sleep that much of the processing of the traumatic experiences occur. When sleep is disrupted (either shorten or disturbed), the traumatic experience can become lodged in the sympathetic nervous system. Over time an accumulation of these unprocessed traumatic experiences can lead to Compassion Fatigue.</li></ul>

						<h4>Tidbits</h4>
						<ul><li>You’re responsible for your task, (God is responsible for ) not the outcomes.</li>
						<li>You’re not God.</li>
						<li>The need will always be greater than the resources.</li>
						<li>Use care in how you measure “success”</li>
						<li>Their pain is not your pain.</li>
						<li>Don’t take them home with you.</li>
						<li>Remember to care for your spirit, emotions and body so that there will be something left to give.</li>
						<li>Value small victories.</li>
						<li>Who you are is as important to the mission as what you do.</li></ul>
